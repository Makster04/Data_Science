Besides being ubiquitous in Data Science, NumPy also provides us with blistering fast and efficient, list-like, data types called N-Dimensional Arrays or **ndarrays** or more simply arrays. This list-like data type is effectively a lighter weight version of a Python **list**, as it uses less of your computer's memory, which makes it more efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets. Don't worry if that seems a little vague. We will take a closer look at NumPy and how its arrays work in this lesson.\n",

However, this performance benefit is only really noticed when dealing with very large datasets. So, for now, the performance benefits of NumPy are purely educational, and we do not need to worry about them just yet.\n",
